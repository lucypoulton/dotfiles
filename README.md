# Lucy's Dotfiles - Flat Grey edition
This is the variation of my dotfiles I run on my laptop. It's flat (no transparency here), grey, and there's a whole load of pink. I've moved the bars around to work a bit better on my laptop, as well as reintroducing workspace displays. I swapped out the font to Roboto Mono. It's kinda cool.
